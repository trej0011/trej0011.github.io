        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Bryan Trejo, I am 20 years old. I am the child of 2 immigrants,<strong> Mayda and Jose.</strong>My family imigrated to Canada from 
        El Salvador in 1987. Growing up I lived all over Ottawa but mostly residing in the west end. I plan to graduate this course with prestigous skills foused in videography and adobe. 
    I own a clothing brand called "Seeking Remedy". My friend and I started this brand about a month ago and have launched it off with polo shirts and trucker hats. </p>
    <p>My goal is to bring influence to the fashion community. Once I get to this goal I plan to start many brands and avenues of creative direction. Currently when im not at school
        i am working on my brand, hanging out with my friends or at my job. Right now I am working at Perkins Restaurent as a server, I have worked here for just about over a year.  </p>
